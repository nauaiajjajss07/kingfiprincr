# Overview

This is a multi-user Python automation application created by **Prince Malhotra** that uses Selenium WebDriver to perform browser-based **Facebook Group Name & Nickname Lock System**. The application features a beautiful web interface with secure user authentication and individual user configurations.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-user authentication system with signup/login
- Beautiful gradient UI with modern design
- User-specific configuration storage
- Encrypted cookie storage for privacy

- **Nickname Lock** - Automatically sets and maintains member nicknames for all configured members
- **Immediate Application** - "Save & Apply Now" button instantly applies settings to Facebook
- **Real-time Configuration Updates** - Monitoring loop picks up config changes immediately
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- **Persistent lock state** - Auto-resumes monitoring after Streamlit restart
- **Duplicate thread prevention** - Ensures single monitoring instance per user

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (Hindi/English mix).

# System Architecture

## Core Application Structure

### Streamlit Web App (streamlit_app.py)
- **Beautiful Multi-User Interface** with gradient design and Poppins font
- **Authentication System**: Secure signup/login with SHA-256 password hashing
- **User Dashboard**: Personal lock configuration management
- **Live Lock System Control**: Start/stop monitoring with real-time logs
- **Group Name Lock**: Automatically detect and revert group name changes
- **Nickname Management**: Add/remove locked nicknames for group members
- **Prince Malhotra Branding**: Throughout the application with lock emoji üîí

### Database Layer (database.py)
- **SQLite Database**: Stores user accounts and lock configurations
- **Secure Password Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 for password security
- **Cookie Encryption**: Fernet encryption for Facebook cookies
- **Lock Configuration Storage**: Stores locked group name and member nicknames (JSON)
- **User Isolation**: Each user's data is completely separate and private

## Security Architecture

### Password Security
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: All passwords are hashed with SHA-256
- **Secure Verification**: Password verification uses hash comparison
- **No Plain Text**: Passwords are never stored in plain text

### Cookie Privacy
- **Fernet Encryption**: Facebook cookies are encrypted before storage
- **Never Displayed**: Cookies are never shown in the UI after saving
- **Per-User Storage**: Each user's cookies are stored separately and securely

### User Isolation
- **Database Foreign Keys**: User configs are linked to user IDs
- **Session Management**: Streamlit session state tracks logged-in users
- **No Data Leakage**: Users can only see their own configurations

## User Flow

1. **New User Signup**:
   - User creates account with username and password
   - System creates encrypted user record with SHA-256
   - Empty lock configuration is initialized for the user
   - User sees blank configuration interface

2. **Login**:
   - User enters credentials
   - System verifies with hash comparison
   - User's saved lock configuration is loaded
   - Cookies remain encrypted and hidden

3. **Lock Configuration**:
   - Group/Conversation ID (Facebook group ID from URL)
   - Locked Group Name (the desired group name to maintain)
   - Facebook Cookies (required for authentication, encrypted storage)
   - Locked Nicknames (member ID ‚Üí nickname mapping in JSON)
   - **Two Save Options**:
     - "Save Configuration" - Saves settings to database only
     - "Save & Apply Now" - Saves AND immediately applies to Facebook

4. **Immediate Application** (New Feature):
   - User clicks "Save & Apply Now" button
   - System opens browser in background
   - Applies locked group name to Facebook immediately
   - Applies all locked nicknames to members immediately
   - Shows success message with real-time logs
   - All changes are visible on Facebook instantly

5. **Lock System**:
   - Start lock monitoring with saved config
   - Browser opens in headless mode
   - System continuously monitors group name and nicknames
   - **Auto-refreshes config** - picks up user changes in real-time
   - Automatically reverts any changes to group name
   - **Enforces nicknames** - reapplies locked nicknames every 3rd check
   - Logs appear in real-time
   - Runs until manually stopped
   - Lock state persists in database
   - Auto-resumes after Streamlit restart
   - Logout automatically stops lock system

## Browser Automation Framework

Uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome driver for browser automation:
- **Headless Chrome**: Runs without visible browser window
- **Cookie Injection**: Adds Facebook cookies for authentication
- **Message Input Detection**: Advanced selectors to find message box
- **Message Rotation**: Cycles through user's message list
- **Real-time Logging**: Shows progress and errors

## Data Flow Architecture

1. User logs in ‚Üí SHA-256 verifies password
2. User lock config loads from SQLite ‚Üí cookies decrypted
3. **Auto-start check**: If lock_enabled=1 in DB, resume lock monitoring
4. **Immediate Application Flow** (New):
   - User clicks "Save & Apply Now" ‚Üí config saved to database
   - System opens browser ‚Üí injects cookies ‚Üí navigates to group
   - Applies locked group name immediately
   - Applies all locked nicknames to members immediately
   - Shows success message to user
5. **Monitoring Flow**:
   - User starts lock system ‚Üí config passed to monitoring thread
   - Selenium opens Facebook ‚Üí injects cookies ‚Üí navigates to group
   - **Every check cycle**: Refreshes lock_config from database
   - Continuously checks group name ‚Üí compares with locked value
   - If changed ‚Üí opens group settings ‚Üí reverts group name
   - **Every 3rd check**: Reapplies all locked nicknames to members
   - Real-time logs update UI ‚Üí user sees progress
6. Lock system runs until user clicks stop or logs out
7. **Streamlit restart**: On app reload, lock system auto-resumes for users
8. **Thread safety**: Duplicate prevention ensures only one thread per user

## UI/UX Design

### Design Elements
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Purple-blue gradients (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Modern Typography**: Poppins font family
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Rounded Corners**: 10-15px border radius throughout
- **Box Shadows**: Elevated card designs
- **Responsive Layout**: Wide layout with proper spacing

### Color Scheme
- Primary: Purple-blue gradient
- Success: Green gradient
- Error: Pink-yellow gradient
- Background: Light gray gradient for cards
- Text: Dark for readability
- Logs: Terminal-style dark background with green text

### Branding
- **Prince Malhotra** name in header and footer
- Lock emoji üîí as favicon and in header
- "Auto-Revert Group Name & Nicknames" tagline
- Copyright footer with ‚ù§Ô∏è
